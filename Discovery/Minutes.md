## Topics Discussed

Introductions
- Betterflye is a community service action tracker with a social media side. 
- Social media aspect of the platform: why the content filter is necessary
- Current state of "filter": users are able to flag offensive content and a admin is notified. 
- - As more users sign onto platform, there is a need for automating this process and blocking offensive content .
- - Want to expand to kids having accounts, need a strict filter in place. 

Requirements

- Main priority is a filtering system that detects and blocks offensive content before it gets posted. 
- Users still can flag posts they think are offensive
- - Admins recieve a message when posts are flagged. 
- Spam filter is also needed
- External links posted on platform should be validated. 
- Needs to have an appeal feature so users can request that blocked content be looked over manually by an employee
- A page currently exists for viewing flagged material, blocked and appealed content will also show up there. 

Tech Info

- PHP runs the current backend, will continue to use this for content filter
- HTML/CSS, JavaScript used for webpages, AJAX for client to server communication. 
- Using XAMPPS stack for local testing. 

Advice

- Get started asap, don't procrastinate. 
- Find your role in the project
- Communication is key

Will meet again for design relatively soon
